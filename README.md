# The Jewish Claims Conference Grants DB

Analysis of the JCC Grants DB from 2013-2017 done as part of the research for a Haaretz magazine article.

**Holocaust Restitution Group Seeks Eviction of German Pensioners From Homes That Belonged to Jews**

For the article: [English version](https://www.haaretz.com/world-news/europe/.premium.MAGAZINE-holocaust-restitution-group-seeks-eviction-of-german-seniors-from-nazi-seized-homes-1.7044683?utm_source=dlvr.it&utm_medium=twitter)| [Hebrew version (original)](https://www.haaretz.co.il/magazine/.premium-MAGAZINE-1.7018860)

See the Jupyter Notebook used for the analysis above.  
The Claims Conference publishes only one year of data on its website (currently 2017). Previous years were scraped from Wayback Machine. For the analysis itself some data cleaning had to be done, as data are presented in different currencies and in an unfriendly format. The resulting Grants DB is added here in an Excel file as well, for those who'd like to look at the data themselves.
